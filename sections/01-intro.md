SM2 [@!GBT.32918.1-2016] [@ISO.IEC.14888-3] [@GMT-0003-2012] [@SM2] [@I-D.shen-sm2-ecdsa],
SM3 [@!GBT.32905-2016] [@ISO.IEC.10118-3] [@GMT-0004-2012] [@SM3] [@I-D.shen-sm3-hash] and
SM4 [@!GBT.32907-2016] [@ISO.IEC.18033-3.AMD2] [@GMT-0002-2012] [@SM4] [@I-D.ribose-cfrg-sm4]
are cryptographic standards issued by the Organization of State Commercial
Administration of China [@OSCCA] as authorized cryptographic algorithms for use
within China. These algorithms are published in public.

Adoption of this document enables exchange of OpenPGP-secured email [@!RFC4880]
in a OSCCA-compliant manner through usage of the authorized combination of
SM2, SM3 and SM4.

SM2 is a set of public key cryptographic algorithms based on elliptic curves
that include:

* Digital Signature Algorithm [@!GBT.32918.2-2016] [@ISO.IEC.14888-3] [@SM2-2]
* Key Exchange Protocol [@!GBT.32918.3-2016] [@SM2-3]
* Public Key Encryption Algorithm [@!GBT.32918.4-2016] [@SM2-4]

SM3 [@!GBT.32905-2016] [@ISO.IEC.10118-3] is a hash algorithm designed for
electronic authentication purposes.

SM4 [@!GBT.32907-2016] [@ISO.IEC.18033-3.AMD2] is a symmetric encryption
algorithm designed for data encryption.

This document extends OpenPGP [@!RFC4880] and its ECC extension
[@!RFC6637] to support SM2, SM3 and SM4:

* support the SM3 hash algorithm for data validation purposes
* support signatures utilizing the combination of SM3 with other digital
  signing algorithms, such as RSA, ECDSA and SM2
* support the SM2 asymmetric encryption algorithm for public key
  operations
* support usage of SM2 in combination with supported hash algorithms, such as
  SHA-256 and SM3
* support the SM4 symmetric encryption algorithm for data protection purposes
* defines the OpenPGP profile "OSCCA-SM234" to enable usage of OpenPGP
  in an OSCCA-compliant manner.
