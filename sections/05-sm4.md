# SM4 Symmetric Encryption Algorithm {#sm4-algorithm}

SM4 [@!GBT.32907-2016] [@I-D.ribose-cfrg-sm4] [@ISO.IEC.18033-3.AMD2]
[@GMT-0002-2012] [@SM4] is a symmetric encryption algorithm designed by
Shuwang Lu et al. originally intended for the usage of wireless local area
network (Wireless LAN) products.

SM4 is a 128-bit blockcipher, uses a key size of 128 bits and
internally uses an 8-bit S-box. It performs 32 rounds per block.
Decryption is achieved by reversing the order of encryption.

SMS4 was first published in public as part of WAPI (Wired Authentication
and Privacy Infrastructure), the Chinese National Standard for Wireless LAN
[@GB.15629.11-2003]. It was then published independently by the OSCCA in 2006
[@SM4], formally renamed to SM4 in 2012 [@GMT-0002-2012],
published as a Chinese National Standard in 2016 [@!GBT.32907-2016], and
included in [@ISO.IEC.18033-3.AMD2] in 2017.

It is a required encryption algorithm specified in WAPI [@GB.15629.11-2003].
