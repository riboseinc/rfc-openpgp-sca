# SM4 Symmetric Encryption Algorithm {#sm4-algorithm}

SM4 [@!GBT.32907-2016] [@GMT-0002-2012] [@SM4] is a symmetric encryption
algorithm designed by Shuwang Lu et al. originally intended for the usage of
wireless local area network (Wireless LAN) products.

SMS4 was first published in public by the OSCCA in 2006 [@SM4], formally
renamed as SM4 [@GMT-0002-2012] in 2012, and eventually published as the
Chinese National Standard [@!GBT.32907-2016].

It is a required encryption algorithm specified in WAPI (Wired Authentication
and Privacy Infrastructure), the Chinese National Standard for Wireless LAN
[@GB.15629.11-2003].

SM4 is a 128-bit block cipher, uses a key size of 128 bits and
internally uses an 8-bit S-box.
It performs 32 rounds per block. Decryption is achieved by reversing the
order of encryption.
