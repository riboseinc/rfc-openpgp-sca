#  Security Considerations

* Products and services that utilize cryptography are regulated by 
  the OSCCA <<OSCCA>>; they must be explicitly approved or certified by 
  the OSCCA before being allowed to be sold or used in China.  

* SM2 <<GBT.32918.1-2016>> is an elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC) 
  approved by the OSCCA <<OSCCA>>.  Its security relies on the 
  assumption that the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECLP) 
  is computationally infeasible. With advances in cryptanalysis, new 
  attack algorithms may reduce the complexity of ECLP, making it easier 
  to attack the SM2 cryptosystem that is considered secure at the time 
  this document is published. You **SHOULD** check current literature 
  to determine if the algorithms in SM2 have been found vulnerable.

* There are security concerns with regards to side-channel attacks 
  against ECCs, including template attacks (such as <<SM2-Template>>) 
  that rely on physical access to the computation device. An 
  implementer of ECC systems **SHOULD** be aware of potential 
  vulnerabilities in this regard.

* SM3 <<GBT.32905-2016>> is a cryptographic hash algorithm approved 
  by the OSCCA <<OSCCA>>.  No formal proof of security is provided. As 
  claimed in <<I-D.shen-sm3-hash>>, the security properties of SM3 are 
  under public study.  There are no known feasible attacks against the 
  SM3 algorithm at the time this document is published.

* SM4 <<GBT.32907-2016>> is a blockcipher approved by the OSCCA 
  <<OSCCA>>.  Security considerations of SM4 offered in 
  <<I-D.ribose-cfrg-sm4>> apply.  No formal proof of security is 
  provided but there are no known feasible attacks against the SM4 
  algorithm by the time of publishing this document.

There are, however, security concerns with regards to side-channel
  attacks, when the SM4 algorithm is implemented in a device 
  <<SM4-Power>>. For instance, <<SM4-Power>> illustrated an attack by 
  measuring the power consumption of the device. A chosen ciphertext 
  attack, assuming a fixed correlation between the sub-keys and data 
  mask, is able to recover the round key successfully. When the SM4 
  algorithm is implemented in hardware, the parameters/keys **SHOULD** 
  be randomly generated without fixed correlation.  

* SM2 has a key length of 512 bits for the public key and 256 bits 
  for the private key.  It is considered an alternative to ECDSA P-256 
  <<RFC6637>>. Its security strength is comparable to a 128-bit 
  symmetric key strength <<I-D.ietf-msec-mikey-ecc>>, e.g., AES-128 
  <<NIST.FIPS.197>>.

* SM3 is a hash function that generates a 256-bit hash value. It is 
  considered as an alternative to SHA-256 <<RFC6234>>.

* SM4 is a blockcipher symmetric algorithm with a key length of 128 
  bits. It is considered as an alternative to AES-128 <<NIST.FIPS.197>>.

* Security considerations offered in <<RFC6637>> and <<RFC4880>> also 
  apply.
