# SM3 Hash Algorithm {#sm3-algorithm}

The SM3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm [@!SM3] is an iterated hash function
designed by Xiaoyun Wang et al., published by [@OSCCA] as an alternative
to SHA-2 [@NIST.FIPS.180-4].

The algorithm is designed to be used for various commercial
cryptographic applications including, but not limited to:

* digital signatures and their verification
* message authentication code generation and their verification
* generation of random numbers

According to the authors, SM3 is designed with a Merkle-Damgard
construction and is very similar to SHA-2 [@NIST.FIPS.180-4]
of the MD4 [@RFC6150] family, with
the addition of several strengthening features such as a more complex
step function and stronger message dependency than SHA-256
[@SM3-Boomerang].

SM3 produces an output hash value of 256 bits long, based on 512-bit
input message blocks [@SM3-Boomerang], on input lengths up to $$2^(m)$$.

The specification of SM3 is described in [@SM3] and [@I-D.shen-sm3-hash].
