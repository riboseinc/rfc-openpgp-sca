# SM3 Hash Algorithm {#sm3-algorithm}

The SM3 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm [@!GBT.32905-2016] is an iterative hash
function designed by Xiaoyun Wang et al., published by [@OSCCA] as an
alternative to SHA-2 [@NIST.FIPS.180-4].

It was first published by the OSCCA in public in 2010 [@SM3], then published
in the OSCCA standard [@GMT-0004-2012] in 2012, published as a Chinese National
Standard as [@!GBT.32905-2016] in 2016, and included in the [@ISO.IEC.10118-3]
standard in 2017.

The algorithm is designed to be used for commercial cryptographic applications
including, but not limited to:

* digital signatures and their verification
* message authentication code generation and their verification
* generation of random numbers

SM3 has a Merkle-Damgard construction and is similar to SHA-2
[@NIST.FIPS.180-4] of the MD4 [@RFC6150] family, with the addition of several
strengthening features including a more complex step function and stronger
message dependency than SHA-256 [@SM3-Boomerang].

SM3 produces an output hash value of 256 bits long, based on 512-bit
input message blocks [@SM3-Boomerang], on input lengths up to $$2^(m)$$.

The specification of SM3 is described in [@!GBT.32905-2016], [@SM3] and
[@I-D.shen-sm3-hash].
