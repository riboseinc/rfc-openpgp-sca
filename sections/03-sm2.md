# SM2 ECC Algorithms {#sm2-algorithm}

SM2 is an elliptic curve based cryptosystem (ECC) [@!GBT.32918.1-2016]
[@GMT-0003-2012] [@SM2] [@I-D.shen-sm2-ecdsa] designed by Xiaoyun Wang
et al. and published by [@OSCCA].

It was first published by the OSCCA in public in 2010 [@SM2], then received
the designation [@GMT-0003-2012] in 2012, and published as a Chinese national
standard (GB standard) as [@!GBT.32918.1-2016].

The SM2 cryptosystem is composed of three distinct algorithms:

* an elliptical curve digital signature algorithm ("SM2DSA") [@!GBT.32918.2-2016]
  [@SM2-2], also described in [@I-D.shen-sm2-ecdsa];
* a key exchange protocol ("SM2KEP") [@!GBT.32918.3-2016] [@SM2-3]; and
* a public key encryption algorithm ("SM2PKE") [@!GBT.32918.4-2016] [@SM2-4].

This document will refer to all three algorithms for the usage of
OpenPGP [@RFC4880].

## SM2 Digital Signature Algorithm

The SM2 Digital Signature Algorithm is intended for digital signature
and verifications in commercial cryptographic applications, including,
but not limited to:

* identity authentication
* protection of data integrity
* verification of data authenticity

The process of digital signature signing and verifying along with their
examples are found in [@!GBT.32918.2-2016] [@SM2-2], and also described
in [@I-D.shen-sm2-ecdsa].

The SM2DSA process requires usage of a hash function within. For
OSCCA-compliant usage, a OSCCA-compliant hash function such as
SM3 [@!GBT.32905-2016] **MUST** also be used.

In terms of OpenPGP usage, SM2DSA is an alternative to the ECDSA algorithm
specified in [@RFC6637].

The SM2DSA algorithm has been cryptanalyzed to a certain extent, with the
current strongest attack being nonce [@SM2-DSA-Nonces] [@SM2-DSA-Nonces2]
and lattice attacks [@SM2-DSA-Lattice].

For OpenPGP compatability, these additional requirements **MUST** be adhered
to:

* SM2DSA allows use of an optional "user identity" string which is
  hashed into `ZA` (Section 3.5 of [@SM2-2] and Section 5.1.4.4 of
  [@I-D.shen-sm2-ecdsa]). In OpenPGP, the user identifier `IDA`
  **MUST** be the empty string.

* While SM2DSA usually signs `H(ZA || msg)` (Section 4.1 [@SM2-2]),
  but in OpenPGP, following the convention of [@RFC6637], we do not directly
  sign the raw message `msg`, but its hash `H(msg)`. Therefore when
  a message is signed by SM2DSA in OpenPGP, the algorithm **MUST** sign
  the content of `H(ZA || H(msg))` instead of `H(ZA || msg)`.
  Both hash algorithms used here **MUST** be identical.

## SM2 Key Exchange Protocol

The SM2 Key Exchange Protocol is used for cryptographic key exchange,
allowing the negotiation and exchange of a session key within two to
three message transfers.

The process of key exchange and verification along with their examples
are found in [@!GBT.32918.3-2016] [@SM2-3], and also described in
[@I-D.shen-sm2-ecdsa].

SM2KEP is not used with OpenPGP as it is a two- to three- pass key
exchange mechanism, while in OpenPGP, public keys of recipients are
available initially.

The SM2KEP is now considered insecure due to [@SM2-KEP-Comments], similar
in status to the Unified Model and MQV schemes described in
[@NIST.SP.800-56Ar2].


## SM2 Public Key Encryption

The SM2 Public Key Encryption algorithm is an elliptic curve
(ECC) based asymmetric encryption algorithm. It is used for
cryptographic encryption and decryption, allowing the message sender to
utilize the public key of the message receiver to encrypt the message,
with the recipient decrypting the messaging using his private key.

The full description of SM2PKE is provided in [@!GBT.32918.4-2016].

It utilizes a public key size of 512 bits and private key size of 256
bits [@!GBT.32918.4-2016] [@GMT-0003-2012].

The process of encryption and decryption, along with their examples are
found in [@!GBT.32918.4-2016] and [@SM2-4].

The SM2PKE process requires usage of a hash function within. For
OSCCA-compliant usage, a OSCCA-compliant hash function such as
SM3 [@!GBT.32905-2016] **MUST** also be used.

In OpenPGP, SM2PKE is an alternative to RSA specified in [@RFC4880].


## Recommended SM2 Curve

The recommended curve is specified in [@!GBT.32918.5-2017] [@SM2-5]
and provided here for reference. SM2 uses a 256-bit elliptic curve.
